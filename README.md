# OpenCV Image Reading, Displaying and

This repository contains my first computer vision exercise under **Zgt Studio**.  
The goal is to load the classic `cameraman.tif` image with OpenCV, display it in a window and save a grayscale copy.

## Files

- `main.py` – simple script that:
  - reads `cameraman.tif` in grayscale mode,
  - shows the image in a window,
  - saves a copy as `new_black_white_image.png`.
- `cameraman.tif` – classic test image used in many image processing examples.

> If your Python file has a different name (for example `cameraman_basic.py`), update the filename in this README.

## Project structure

- `main.py`
- `cameraman.tif`

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV for Python

Install the dependency:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
